#Basic functions:
#In order to analyze the contents of these files, we first ask you to develop the following functions: 
#- Extract the names of the presidents from the names of the text files provided ;
#- Associate a first name with each president;
#- Display the list of president's names (watch out for duplicates) ; 
#- Convert the texts in the 8 files to lower case and store the contents in new files. The new files are to be stored in a new folder called "cleaned". This folder should be located in the main directory of the main.py program, and at the same level as the "speeches" directory.
#- For each file stored in the "cleaned" directory, run through its text and remove any punctuation characters. 
#The final result should be a file with words separated by spaces. Please note that some characters, such as the apostrophe (') or the dash (-), requires special treatment to avoid concatenating two words (e.g. "ellemême" should become "elle même" and not "ellemême"). Changes made at this phase should be stored in the same files in the "cleaned" directory.

#How the program works : 1-Open the file named "main.py". 2-Execute the program. 3-Finished!
